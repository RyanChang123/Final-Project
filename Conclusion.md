# Peter Lynch Overview:

    Peter Lynch is a legendary investor known for his exceptional success managing the Fidelity Magellan Fund from 1977 to 1990. Born on January 19, 1944, Lynch graduated from Boston College in 1965 with a degree in finance and later earned a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
    Lynch joined Fidelity Investments in 1969 as an intern and eventually became the head of the Magellan Fund in 1977. Under his management, the fund grew from $18 million in assets to over $14 billion, making it one of the largest and most successful mutual funds in the world at the time.
    During his tenure at Magellan, Lynch achieved an average annual return of around 29%. His success made him one of the most respected and influential investors of his time. After retiring from Fidelity in 1990, Lynch continued to be active in the investment community through writing books and giving talks on investing strategies. His book One Up on Wall Street was the inspiriation for this project.
